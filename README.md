# Mario-meets-AI

This project aims to study and analyse the effects of Artificial Intelligence being a part of a team. The question is: how well can AI collaborate with humans to work towards and achieve a goal in a team environment and how does it affect the performance as compared to a team of humans? With the help of this study, one can put up an argument that there is no significant difference in the performance of the teams involving an AI agent when compared to a team of humans. This project involved players playing a mini-game called ‘Dash and Dine’ of the video game ‘Super Mario Party’ which requires them to work together around a small kitchen to nab requested ingredients. In the end, it was clear that substituting a player with an AI agent or a new player (newhire) or even playing with the same teams did not account for any significant difference. This can prove to be a very important argument for those who believe that AI can thrive and replace humans for the better in all the jobs that humans are currently doing.
